    Draw a circle segment on a NumPy array (image) with a given origin (center).
    angles are measured as row = x, column = y, so heading 0 points down in the image (positve rows)
    and positive angles rotate counter clockwise
    Parameters:
        image (numpy.ndarray): The NumPy array representing the image.
        origin (tuple): The (x, y) coordinates of the center of the circle segment.
        radius (int): The radius of the circle segment.
        heading (float): The angle (in degrees) to which the circle segment points.
